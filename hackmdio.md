**Resources for continued learning**
* Learn about other courses through fredhutch.io [here](http://www.fredhutch.io/resources/). Intermediate R courses are currently in development, some based on [these lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) from Software Carpentry.
* The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, or Coop, hosts many community meetings and office hours about data science. Learn more information about these groups [here](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/hosted-groups.html), 
* Join the [Coop Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWE5NGUyMTY1NGU0N2VmMmEyNTM5YzM1MmNlMTk2YmM1OWNkMmJiNTQxMTQ4OTNkMTFjMjk3M2Q0MzkwYzQ3NDA) to talk about data science with other Hutch researchers! 
* The [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org)is written by Hutch researchers and staff, and is a great place to find information about data management, bioinformatics, computing, and more.
