# Instructors

- Please see our [instructor repository](https://github.com/fredhutchio/instructors) for general guidelines relevant to all classes. Additional recommendations specific for this course can be found below.
- You may choose to share your script to Dropbox to help folks stay on track. If you create the project in Dropbox, you can copy the link to each week's script and share in HackMD. Files ending in `.R` are rendered as text in a browser window, but learners will need to refresh the screen to see updates.
- Administering challenges: Typing the challenge exercise into the script as a comment is usually easiest. Some challenges that include a chunk of code may be added to the HackMD for learners to copy and paste (or it can be copied from Dropbox if you're sharing your script).
