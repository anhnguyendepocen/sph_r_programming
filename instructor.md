## Notes on teaching

### Week 1
- This class lasts two hours, with a break occuring 45-60 minutes after the start of class. It works well to administer a challenge exercise and then take a 10 minute break, so folks can work on the exercise and/or move around as necessary. Address the challenge after the break before moving on to the next section. 
- Timing can be adjusted with challenge exercises. You can add or remove challenges from a given class, or give more or less time as pacing allows. There are extra challenges in `exercises/`
