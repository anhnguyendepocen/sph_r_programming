# Introduction to R

## Description

Description: This four-week course is designed to introduce attendees to R statistical programming and its broad applications. 
Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees have no prior 
computer coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to use R to import, manipulate, and visualize data.

## Schedule

* [Week 1](week1.R): R syntax, assigning objects, using functions
* [Week 2](week2.R): Data types and structures; slicing and subsetting data
* [Week 3](week3.R): Data manipulation with `dplyr`
* [Week 4](week4.md): Data visualization in `ggplot2`

## Resources

* Each week's materials are described in the R script prefaced with the number of the week. 
* [`0dataset.R`](0dataset.R) includes code used to derive the original data from the 
[National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov). `extra/` holds the original data files used for 
download during the activities, as well as the intermediate data files for each cancer type directly downloaded from NCI-GDC
* [`exercises/`](exercises/) includes a file for each week representing both the aggregated in-class exercises as well as additional 
supplemental exercises for practice
* [`solutions/`](solutions/) includes the solutions for all files in `exercises/`
* [`instructors.md`](instructors.md) includes information for instructors to facilitate teaching each lesson
* [`hackmdio.md`](hackio.md) is an archive of the [interactive webpage](https://hackmd.io) used during lessons
* Information about use of R and RStudio at Fred Hutch is available on the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_R/)
