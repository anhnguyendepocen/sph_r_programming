## Objectives

Last week, 
we got started

This week,
we'll continue by:

- importing data into R
- working with data frames
- subsetting data frames
- manipulating factors

## Loading spreadsheet-style data

review opening project in RStudio

`File -> Open Project` and navigate to the location of your project directory.
Alternatively, using your operating system's file browser,
double click on the `r_intro.Rrpoj` file.

# project organization
# tie into the strength of RStudio projects
# directories for: data, figures, intermediate or results

```{r}
# make a directory
dir.create("data")
```

describe use of buttons to make new directories

overview of tidy data principles

- columns: variables
- rows: observations
- one piece of info per cell

csv: comma separated values (other things besides commas can have separators too though)

```{r}
# download data from url
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredhutchio/R_intro/master/extra/clinical.csv", "data/clinical.csv")
```

getting the right URL for downloading data this way can be tricky: only raw data, not extra HTML!

```{r}
# reading in data and saving to object
clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")
```

click on `clinical` object in environment, 
equivalent to executing `View(clinical)` in Console

tab appears next to script in Source window

About these data:

- describe where data came from and give brief overview of metadata: TCGA clinical data from different cancer types
- show script used to produce data
- note data in tab can't be edited!
- note missing data

Check out the help documentation for `read.csv` for more information on importing data in formats other than csv.

# read.csv is one of a family of commands to import data

**Challenge:** download, inspect, and import the following data files (smaller set of data from same clinical set)

- example1: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredhutchio/R_intro/master/extra/clinical.tsv
- example2: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredhutchio/R_intro/master/extra/clinical.txt

can also read into R straight from URL using read.csv, but better practice to download data file for reference

## Data frames 

data frames: tabular/spreadsheet data
table where columns are vectors all of same length
columns contain single type of data (characters, integers, factors)

inspect data frames

```{r}
# assess size of data frame
dim(clinical)
# preview content
head(clinical) # show first few rows
tail(clinical) # show last few rows
```


```{r}
# view names
names(clinical) # column names
```

It's also possible to view row names using`rownames(clinical)`,
but our data only possess numbers for row names so it's not very informative.

```{r}
str(clinical) # structure of object
```


```{r}
summary(clinical) # summary statistics by column
```


**Challenge**: What is the class, how many rows/columns, how many types of cancer (disease)?

## Subsetting data frames


```{r}
# extract first column
clinical[1]
```

rows, columns

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# extract first column
clinical[ , 1]
```


**Challenge:** what is the difference in results between the last two lines of code?

```{r}

```



# extract first row, first column
clinical[1,1]
# extract single row 
clinical[1, ]
# extract a range of cells
clinical[1:3, 2] # rows 1 to 3, second column
# exclude certain data subsets
clinical[ , -1] # exclude first column
clinical[-c(1:100), ] # exclude first 100 rows
# save extracted data to new object
test_clinical <- clinical[1:20, ]

# extract columns by name
clinical["tumor_stage"] # result is data.frame
clinical[ , "tumor_stage"] # results in vector
clinical[["tumor_stage"]] # results in vector
clinical$tumor_stage # results in vector
# reference exploring different types of subsetting: https://davetang.org/muse/2013/08/16/double-square-brackets-in-r/

#### BREAK ####

## Challenge: code as many different ways possible to extract the column days_to_death

## Challenge: extract the first 6 rows for only age at diagnosis and days to death

## Challenge: calculate the range and mean for cigarettes per day

#### Factors ####

# factors represent categorical data
# predefined sets of values (levels), in alphabetical order
# stored as integers with labels
# can be ordered or unordered

# create factor
test_data <- factor(c("placebo", "test_drug", "placebo", "known_drug"))
levels(test_data) # show levels
nlevels(test_data) # count levels
# show current
test_data
# reorder (may be necessary if order matters)
test_data <- factor(test_data, levels = c("known_drug", "test_drug", "placebo"))
# show reordered
test_data

# converting factors
as.numeric(test_data)
# factors can also appear as numbers! not advisable, but useful to know if accidental

# renaming factors
plot(clinical$race) # plot data (may need to resize the window)
race <- clinical$race # save data to object
levels(race) # show levels of factor
# rename factor
levels(race)[2] <- "Zsian"
race # show revised data
# replace race in data frame
clinical$race <- race
# replot with corrected names
plot(clinical$race)

# for more information, see link on working with categorical data in HackMD

## Challenge: replace "not reported" in ethnicity and race with NA
# do a Google search to find additional strategies for renaming missing data
# when regrouping after challenge, include a demo of looking at search results
#   blog posts (e.g., RStats) may give good tutorials of common tasks
#   Stack Overflow is great, upvotes and simple solutions are great to start

#### Extra: creating a simple data frame without importing data ####

# create individual vectors
cancer <- c("lung", "prostate", "breast")
metastasis <- c("yes", "no", "yes")
cases <- c(30, 50, 100)
# combine vectors
example_df1 <- data.frame(cancer, metastasis, cases)
str(example_df1)

# create vectors and combine at once
example_df2 <- data.frame(cancer = c("lung", "prostate", "breast"),
                          metastasis = c("yes", "no", "yes"),
                          cases = c(30, 50, 100), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # determines whether character or factor
str(example_df2)

#### Wrapping up ####

# review objectives
# direct towards practice questions (linked in HackMD)
# preview next week's objectives
# install tools for next week: install.packages("tidyverse")


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
