## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r prep}
# load library
library(tidyverse)

# read in filtered data from last week
birth_reduced <- read_csv("data/birth_reduced.csv")
smoke_complete <- read_csv("data/smoke_complete.csv")

# create directory for output
dir.create("figures")

# simple plot from base R from the smoke_complete dataset
plot(x=smoke_complete$age_at_diagnosis, y=smoke_complete$cigarettes_per_day)
```

## Intro to ggplot2 and scatterplots

There are three steps to creating a ggplot:
1. bind data: create a new plot with a designated dataset
2. specify the aesthetic: maps the data to axes on a plot
3. add layers: visual representation of plot, including ways (geometries or shapes) through which data are represented and themes; layers represent everything about the way data are presented

```{r}
# basic ggplot
ggplot(data = smoke_complete) # bind data to plot
```

The last line of code creates an empty plot, since we didn't include any instructions for how to 

```{r}
# basic ggplot
ggplot(data = smoke_complete, aes(x = age_at_diagnosis, 
                           y = cigarettes_per_day)) # specify aesthetics (axes)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = smoke_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = age_at_diagnosis, y = cigarettes_per_day)) + 
  geom_point() # add a layer of geometry
```
